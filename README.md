# SocialNetwork-Manager
A social media model using unweighted, undirected graphs. Supports adding/removing users, managing friendships, finding shortest paths (with/without blacklists), checking friendships, and recommending top-k users based on mutual friends. Graph is stored as an edge list; paths and results use vectors.
